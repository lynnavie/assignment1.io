		<summary><b> History of Fort Canning Park</b>	</summary>
		<section style="padding:20px">
				<b>Fort Canning Park</b> is an iconic hilltop landmark that has witnessed many of Singapore's historical milestones. <br>
				The hill originally known as Bukit Larangan <i>(or "Forbidden Hill" in Malay)</i>
				once sited the palaces of 14th Century kings, and also Sir Stamford Raffles' first home.
				<br>
				It was then converted into a fort in 1860 and renamed Fort Canning in honour of 
				Viscount Charles John Canning, Governor-General and first Viceroy of India.
				In the 1920s and 1930s, the hill was transformed into an artillery fort with barracks, 
				officers' quarters, old gunpowder magazine and a hospital.
				On 15 February 1942, the decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese was made on the hill, 
				in the Underground Far East Command Centre, now known as the Battle Box.
				<br>
				Now, Fort Canning Park is a venue for celebrations. Hosting many local and international events on its lawns.
				With loads of activities for people of all ages, to explore.
